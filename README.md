Link for the whole project.

1. 2 terminals
2. One gets into the folder and "npm start"
3. Second goes into the "back_endApi" folder and "python app.py"
4. The react screen will show up, go to the upload page and upload a video. The only video that works is "demo_test" in "public/uploads"
5. When the preview shows up or doesn't, go to watch and play around with the video
